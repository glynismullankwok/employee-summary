# Template Engine - Employee Summary

As a manager, it would be great to generate a webpage that displays my team and their information, in a quick and easy manner.  This project is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also, a major concern for developing code, is that the code passes testing, this is also addressed in this project.
